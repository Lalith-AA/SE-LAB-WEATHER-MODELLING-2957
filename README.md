# SE-LAB-WEATHER-MODELLING-2957
Weather Modeling Using Quadratic Equation Solver

This project demonstrates a staged approach to building a simple weather-model–style computational system using the quadratic formula.
The quadratic equation:

𝑎
𝑥
2
+
𝑏
𝑥
+
𝑐
=
0
ax
2
+bx+c=0

is used to compute two potential “weather state” values based on the coefficients a, b, and c.

The project progresses through multiple development stages, starting with basic hard-coded variables and advancing to keyboard input, reading from files, and processing multiple datasets. Each stage is preserved as a separate version to demonstrate incremental development and debugging.
